First build the physics library by running "Bullet282-for-Marmalade/Bullet.mkb"
Ensure you do so for all required solution configurations (x86 debug, x86 release, arm gcc...)

NOT ALL 'EXTRAS' ARE INCLUDED YET (todo: add more extras in both .mkf files)

I have built X86 version (outside of Marmalade) of all official demos and included in the file
"Bullet282_Xammond/Bullet282-for-Marmalade/Bullet282_Demos_(COMPILED_Win32).zip"
